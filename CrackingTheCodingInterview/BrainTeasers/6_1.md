##We have 20 bottles with pills. 19 bottles with 1.0g pills and 1 with 1.1g pills. We have scale which we can use once. How to know which bottle have heavy pills.

Lets us take 1 from bottle #1, 2 from #2 ... 20 from #20. 
If all that pills are 1.0g scale will return us (1 + 20) / 2 * 20 = 210g, 
but we have heavy pills => we will see more than 210g.
So, if m - scaled weight: (m - 210) / 0.1 = index of heavy bottle.
