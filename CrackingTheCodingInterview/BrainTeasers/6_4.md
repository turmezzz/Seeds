Task: All blue eyed gays must leave island. There is a flight every evening. 
      We know that we have at least 1 gay (no no homo).
      We can't speak about eye colors of people (because ra...).
      How many days they need?
      
If person sees no gay it means that he (your mum) is gay, so he leaves island that day.
If person sees one gay who do not leave at first day it means that he is gay again. 
And they leave next day. 
If 3 we wait 2 days and if nobody leaves it means that we are gay with 2 others and leave.
So, if we have m gays on island we need m days to make island people without blue eyed neighbors.

But actually all island citizens must leave at first day and there will be no blue eyed people after 1 day.
